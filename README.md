Task-02
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history
It includes :

Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering: Analyzes customer data to segment them into groups using K-Means clustering.
Data Exploration and Visualization: Utilizes numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for exploring and visualizing data distributions and relationships.
Cluster Analysis: Implements K-Means clustering to segment customers based on Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
Elbow Method: Determines optimal cluster number using the elbow method for both 2D and 3D data representations.
Deployment Insights: Provides insights on deploying clustering models in production for customer segmentation applications.
